# portfolio-backEnd1

This repository contains the backend implementation for the portfolio application, built using NestJS. It provides a RESTful API to manage various portfolio links categorized into sections like portfolio, real estate, more about me, and contact. The API supports CRUD operations to create, read, update, and delete these links.

The backend is configured to connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. To run the application, install the dependencies using npm install and start the server with npm run start. Make sure to set up your MongoDB connection string in the environment variables. You can test the API using tools like Postman or cURL.
